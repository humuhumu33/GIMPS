# Homomorphic Resonance Factorization: A Mathematical Framework

## 1. Foundational Principles

### 1.1 Resonance Homomorphism

Let **R: B^n → ℝ^+** be the resonance function. The fundamental discovery is that R exhibits homomorphic properties under specific operations.

**Definition 1.1** (Resonance Homomorphism). For the five CCM subgroups H ⊆ B^n:
- H₀ = {0} (trivial)
- H₁ = {0,1} (binary) 
- H₂ = {0,48} (periodic-48)
- H₃ = {0,49} (composite)
- H₄ = V₄ = {0,1,48,49} (Klein)

The resonance function satisfies:
```
∀h₁,h₂ ∈ Hᵢ: R(h₁ ⊕ h₂) = Φᵢ(R(h₁), R(h₂))
```
where Φᵢ is the composition law for subgroup Hᵢ.

### 1.2 Concatenation Algebra

**Definition 1.2** (Concatenation Resonance). For bit sequences a ∈ B^m, b ∈ B^n:
```
R(a||b) = R(a) ⊗ R(b) ⊗ Ψ(m,n)
```
where:
- || denotes concatenation
- ⊗ is the resonance product operator
- Ψ(m,n) is the boundary correction term

**Theorem 1.1** (Homomorphic Concatenation). If a,b belong to homomorphic subgroup Hᵢ:
```
R(a||b) = R(a) · R(b) · κᵢ(|a|,|b|)
```
where κᵢ is computable from the subgroup structure.

## 2. Factor Manifestation Theory

### 2.1 Prime Signature Theorem

**Theorem 2.1** (Prime Resonance Signature). For prime p:
```
R(p) = 1 (unit resonance)
||embed(p)||_c = 1 (unit coherence norm)
```

**Corollary 2.1**. For composite n = p·q:
```
R(n) = R(p) * R(q) * τ(p,q)
```
where τ encodes the multiplicative structure.

### 2.2 Resonance Decomposition

**Definition 2.1** (Resonance Spectrum). The resonance spectrum of n is:
```
Spec_R(n) = {(ω, A(ω)) : ω ∈ Ω}
```
where:
- Ω is the frequency domain
- A(ω) is the amplitude at frequency ω

**Theorem 2.2** (Factor Frequency Theorem). If n = p·q, then:
```
Spec_R(n) = Spec_R(p) ⊛ Spec_R(q) + I(p,q)
```
where:
- ⊛ is spectral convolution
- I(p,q) is the interference pattern

## 3. Streaming Factorization Framework

### 3.1 Chunk Decomposition

**Definition 3.1** (Canonical Chunking). For N-bit number n, the canonical k-chunking is:
```
n = ⊕ᵢ₌₀^{⌈N/k⌉-1} cᵢ · 2^{ik}
```
where cᵢ ∈ B^k are k-bit chunks.

### 3.2 Resonance Flow

**Definition 3.2** (Resonance Flow Operator). The flow operator F maps chunk sequences to resonance sequences:
```
F: (c₀, c₁, ..., cₘ) ↦ (r₀, r₁, ..., rₘ)
where rᵢ = R(cᵢ)
```

**Theorem 3.1** (Flow Preservation). Factor structure is preserved under F:
```
If n = p·q, then F(chunks(n)) exhibits periodic structure with period related to p,q
```

### 3.3 Homomorphic Accumulation

**Definition 3.3** (Resonance Accumulator). The accumulator A maintains running state:
```
A₀ = 1
Aᵢ₊₁ = Φ(Aᵢ, rᵢ, i)
```
where Φ is the homomorphic composition operator.

**Theorem 3.2** (Factor Detection). Factors manifest as fixed points:
```
If p|n, then ∃k: Aₖ = A_{k+ord(p)}
```

## 4. Multi-Scale Analysis

### 4.1 Scale Hierarchy

**Definition 4.1** (Scale Hierarchy). The scale hierarchy S is:
```
S = {2^λ : λ ∈ Λ}
```
where Λ = {8, 10, 12, 14, ...} are the analysis scales.

### 4.2 Cross-Scale Coherence

**Theorem 4.1** (Scale Invariance). Factor signatures exhibit scale invariance:
```
If pattern P appears at scale s, then related pattern P' appears at scale 2s
```

**Definition 4.2** (Cross-Scale Coherence). The coherence between scales s₁, s₂:
```
C(s₁,s₂) = ⟨Spec_R^{s₁}(n), Spec_R^{s₂}(n)⟩
```

Factors maximize cross-scale coherence.

## 5. Interference Factorization

### 5.1 Wave Formulation

**Definition 5.1** (Resonance Wave). The resonance wave of n:
```
Ψ_n(x) = Σᵢ aᵢe^{iωᵢx}
```
where (ωᵢ, aᵢ) ∈ Spec_R(n).

### 5.2 Self-Interference

**Theorem 5.1** (Factor Interference). For n = p·q:
```
|Ψ_n(x)|² = |Ψ_p(x)|² + |Ψ_q(x)|² + 2Re(Ψ_p(x)Ψ*_q(x))
```

The interference term reveals factor relationships.

### 5.3 Holographic Principle

**Theorem 5.2** (Holographic Factorization). Each chunk contains information about the global factor structure:
```
I(chunk_i) ≥ H(factors)/N
```
where I is information content, H is entropy.

## 6. Asymptotic Analysis

### 6.1 Complexity

**Theorem 6.1** (Streaming Complexity). Factoring N-bit number n:
- Space: O(polylog(N))
- Time: O(N · polylog(N))
- Resonance evaluations: O(N/k) where k is chunk size

### 6.2 Information Bounds

**Theorem 6.2** (Information-Theoretic Limit). The minimum chunk size k_min for reliable factor detection:
```
k_min ≥ log²(p) where p is smallest prime factor
```

## 7. Algorithmic Principles

### 7.1 Detection Strategies

**Principle 1** (Resonance Periodicity). Scan for periodic patterns in (r₀, r₁, ...).

**Principle 2** (Homomorphic Fixed Points). Identify when Aᵢ stabilizes under composition.

**Principle 3** (Cross-Scale Peaks). Factors appear as peaks persisting across scales.

**Principle 4** (Interference Maximization). Factors maximize self-interference.

### 7.2 Verification Protocol

**Theorem 7.1** (Probabilistic Verification). Given candidate factors p̃, q̃:
```
P(p̃·q̃ = n | resonance_match) > 1 - 2^{-k}
```

## 8. Quantum Mechanical Interpretation

### 8.1 Measurement Collapse

The streaming process resembles quantum measurement:
- Chunks are "measurements" of the number
- Each measurement partially collapses the factor superposition
- Complete factorization occurs when sufficient measurements accumulate

### 8.2 Entanglement

**Theorem 8.1** (Factor Entanglement). In resonance space:
```
|n⟩ = |p⟩ ⊗ |q⟩ + |entangled⟩
```

The entangled component decreases with chunk size.

## 9. Fundamental Limits

### 9.1 No-Go Theorems

**Theorem 9.1** (Minimum Information). Cannot factor with chunks smaller than:
```
k < min(log p, log q)
```

**Theorem 9.2** (Resonance Resolution). Distinguishing factors requires:
```
|R(p) - R(q)| > ε(k)
```
where ε(k) → 0 as k → ∞.

## 10. Grand Unification

### 10.1 The Factorization Functional

**Definition 10.1** (Master Functional). The factorization functional F[n]:
```
F[n] = ∫ D[Ψ] exp(iS[Ψ,n])
```
where S is the action encoding resonance dynamics.

**Theorem 10.1** (Stationary Phase). Factors correspond to stationary points:
```
δS/δΨ|_{Ψ=Ψ_p} = 0 ⟺ p|n
```

### 10.2 Universal Property

**Conjecture** (Universality). The homomorphic resonance framework captures all computational aspects of factorization - any algorithm can be expressed as resonance flow operations.

This framework transforms factorization from a discrete search problem into a continuous flow problem in resonance space, where homomorphic properties enable processing numbers of arbitrary size through local, streaming analysis.
